<h2>3. Sale of tickets.</h2>
<h3>3.1. Information of the Ticket.</h3>
<p>Once registered, the User that is interested in offering a Ticket will publish it on the Website completing in a detailed, authentic and accurate way the fields included in the sell-flow. Subject to Section 3.10, it is mandatory to give at least the following information amongst others: the name of the event for which the Tickets are being offered, the date of the event, the Ticket type being offered, possible restrictions of the offered Ticket and the desired price for the exchange (an "Offer"). </p>
<p>The Seller is also obligated to indicate a credit/debit card number of which the expiration date must be after the date of the event for which the Tickets are being offered, and the desired payment method, so that StubHub can transfer, in the case of a purchase of the tickets offered, the amount due from the transaction. The available forms of payment are those stated in the selling form on the Website. </p>

<h3>3.2. Publication of the Offer.</h3>
<p>The publications made by the User on the Website gives StubHub and, in certain cases, associated and/or participating companies, the non-exclusive right to publish and exhibit the entered data on further websites that belong to the holders. With its publication, the User is obligated to accept and complete the transactions specified within the Terms and Conditions of StubHub. </p>
<p>The publication of an Offer on the Website also implies the formalization of the work order agreement and the beginning of the Service provided to the Seller by StubHub. Upon the acceptance the Offer by the Buyer, this Service earns fees, and in the case of non-compliance of the contract terms StubHub shall receive compensation. </p>
<p>This Service will yield commissions, and if necessary, economic penalisation for non-compliance in favour of StubHub, once the Buyer has accepted the Offer. Additionally, StubHub has the right to claim loss and damages when appropriate. </p>

<h3>3.3. Term of validity and applicability of published Offers.</h3>
<p>On general terms, the validity of the offered Tickets will be determined by the date of the event of which the Tickets are concerning. Any Offer that is not subject to the "Last Minute Program" system of Tickets published by the Sellers can be valid up until 3 working days prior to the expected date of the event to which the Ticket is offering access to. </p>
<p>However, in certain cases, the term of validity of Offers may vary in accordance with certain circumstances or situations that are outside of the control of StubHub. In such a case, StubHub will inform the Users of any modification of the term of validity of the Offers as soon as it has effective proof of those circumstances. </p>

<h3>3.4. Publication Free of Charge.</h3>
<p>The publication of the Offer is free of charge for the Seller. The percentage fee will only be charged by StubHub in the case of the effective transfer of the Ticket offered, excluding the economic penalisation for non-compliance of the Seller that is determined in section 3.11. </p>

<h3>3.5. Credit/Debit Card.</h3>
<p>At the moment of publishing the Offer, the Seller must facilitate StubHub with a valid credit or debit card number which expires at a date that is subsequent to the event in question. Upon providing this card, the User deliberately authorises StubHub to carry out the charges or debits that may result from the transaction of Tickets and the Services rendered by StubHub in accordance with the present Terms and Conditions.</p>

<h3>3.6. Taxes associated with the transaction of Tickets.</h3>
<p>If the Tickets are subject to duties or taxes, it is the responsibility of the Sellers to determine their kind and amount so as to include them in the final cession price. These duties or taxes are independent from the Value Added Tax (VAT), if applicable, that is levied upon the Services rendered by StubHub to the Users. </p>

<h3>3.7. Determination of the price of the Offer made by the Seller.</h3>
<p>The publication of the Offer by the Seller under the present Terms and Conditions will include the price that the Seller expects to obtain from the transaction. To this effect, the Seller will include the amount desired from the transaction in the selling form provided by the Website. Determination of the price is the sole responsibility of the Seller and StubHub will take no part in this determination, having no influence whatsoever in the determination of offered prices. </p>
<p>In consequence, the price will be set freely by the Seller who must bear in mind the stipulations of paragraph 3.6 regarding taxes associated with the transaction, the fee of the Service offered by StubHub in accordance with paragraph 3.8, and the state law requirements referred to in paragraph 3.10. The Seller may, at any time until the acceptance of their Offer by a Buyer, modify the desired price offered for the transaction. </p>

<h3>3.8. Cost of the Service to Offer Tickets.</h3>
<p>The use of the Website by a Seller to make Offers accrues the cost of the Service in favour of StubHub for all transactions effectively carried out through the Website. This cost of the Services rendered by StubHub will be determined in the following fashion: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>A percentage will be accrued from the price or liquid amount that the Seller desires to obtain from the transaction made. This percentage of the commission constitutes the fee of Services rendered by StubHub. You can find the final percentage of the said commission in the following link: <a href="https://www.stubhub.com.au/information/commissions">https://www.stubhub.com.au/information/commissions</a></li>
		<li>The resulting amount will be imposed the Value Added Tax (VAT), if applicable in force at the time of the transaction. </li>
		<li>The final cost of the Service will be the sum both of the previously mentioned amounts. </li>
	</ul>
	
<h3>3.9. Linking the Seller to an accepted Offer.</h3>
<p>Once StubHub has sent the first email to the Seller informing them that, depending on the case, the sale is pending or confirmed, the Offer cannot be withdrawn or modified, and the Seller must save the Tickets at the disposal of the Buyer. Once a transaction on an Offer is accepted by the Buyer StubHub will send an email confirming the sale and the Seller must carry out the transaction in a manner that the Buyer may make effective use of the acquired Tickets.  </p>
<p>All sales are final. StubHub will not be held responsible for the conditions of the events taking place, any possible change of venue, scheduling, line-up, or any cancellation of the event that might occur. If the situations detailed in the previous paragraph were to take place, cancellation of payments due from the completion of transactions will only be done by discretion of StubHub. </p>

<h3>3.10 Compliance with state laws</h3>
<p>Many states in Australia regulate the resale of tickets. The sale of tickets which is in breach of those laws is prohibited on our platform. By using our services, You agree that your listing and transaction is compliant with all laws. For further information about the laws in each state please see the section on <a href="https://www.stubhub.com.au/information/ticket-restrictions">Additional Information on State Restrictions</a>. </p>
<h3>3.11. Non-compliance by the Seller. Penalisations:</h3>
<p>StubHub will apply economic penalties in the form of financial charges to Sellers of transactions which are not successfully completed due to error or non-compliance by the Seller of the Tickets. These charges reflect the costs incurred by StubHub for the resolution of requests which have not been duly completed. StubHub also reserves the right to close the account of any Seller if the Seller repeatedly commits error or non-compliance. Said penalties will be imposed on the Seller under the following circumstances:</p> 
	<ul>
		<li>a) A Ticket is sent after the maximum term set by StubHub for sending purchased tickets has expired; </li>
		<li>b) The Ticket sent differs from the Offer published, with independence of whether they may be subjectively considered equal or of better value to the Offer published; </li>
		<li>c) StubHub must enforce the Ticket replacement operation in order to be able to complete a transaction in which the Seller has not complied or has committed error; </li>
		<li>d) Refund or Reimbursement is made to the Buyer, for any reason in which the Seller is responsible for incompletion of the sale. </li>
	</ul>
<p>The penalties applied by StubHub to the Sellers will always have the form of financial charges. These will be done through the means provided by the Seller as guarantee of the sale or on the total amount of sales pending payment to the Seller. Whichever their form, administrative charges will be applied automatically by StubHub, if and when the Seller falls within the non-compliance stipulated as follows. Penalizations will be charged with any applicable Taxes.</p>

<h4>3.11.1 Penalisation for the tardy delivery of Tickets.</h4>
<p>Tickets sold must be shipped within 72 hours after the available date that you selected when you published the tickets. In case the tickets are sent after this period, the Seller will be automatically penalized for each package that is delivered late. The economic penalisation for tardy delivery may be consulted at the following link: <u><a href="https://www.stubhub.com.au/information/penalties" target="_blank">Penalties</a></u>.</p>
<p>This charge corresponds to the cost to StubHub for the investigation of the state of the shipment of an order and attending the enquiries of the Buyers. The Seller will receive the value of the order, minus the fee of the sale and the amount of the penalisation for tardy delivery, which is previously indicated. </p>
<p>This penalty fee will not apply in the following cases: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>a) Sales that take place only five (5) days prior to the event. </li>
		<li>b) Offers made under the Last Minute Program. </li>
	</ul>
	
<h4>3.11.2	Penalisation for shipment of erroneous tickets accepted by the Buyer.</h4>
<p>When the Tickets sent are not exactly those which have been described in the listing, but the Buyer accepts the tickets that have been sent, then an economic penalty for incorrect Tickets will be applied to the order, which will correspond with the amount discounted by StubHub to the Buyer so that they Buyer might accept the erroneous Tickets. This amount discounted by StubHub for the Buyer as compensation will be solely decided by StubHub and directly relinquished to the Buyer. </p>
<p>The Seller will therefore receive the value of the sale minus any fee for the sale, and minus the compensation discount awarded to the Buyer (when applicable). If the Buyer does NOT accept the Tickets offered as substitution, the order will be considered as failed and a "failed order" penalty fee will be applied (see section 3.11.3 below). </p>
<p>The Tickets will be considered as erroneous in the following cases:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Seats in an aisle different from that which was published;</li>
		<li>Seats in a sector that is different from that which was listed (much like the previous point);</li>
		<li>Seats located in an area that is higher than that which was listed, independently of the distance to the stage;</li>
		<li>Any change from Reserved Seating to General Admission and vice versa;</li>
		<li>Any seats where the perspective of the client to the showground is altered;</li>
		<li>Separate seats, when they should be together (tickets offered in the same listing);</li>
		<li>Seats offered as "together" but which in fact are not side-by-side;</li>
		<li>Restrictions upon the tickets which were not clearly stated upon publication of the offer;</li>
		<li>Tickets of a different category from that offered, in accordance with the map of the Website.</li>
	</ul>
<p>The cases described in the previous points are applied according to the divisions and categories established in the map in Stubhub. In this way, the listings and the Tickets must reflect the divisions and categories of the map of the event as made available by StubHub. If there were no map, the ticket types will be those established by the promoter of the event. </p>

<h4>3.11.3 Penalisations for failed orders.</h4>
<p>StubHub considers a failed order as the following cases: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Undelivered Tickets</li>
		<li>Incorrect delivery, the Buyer receives erroneous tickets that they do not accept.</li>
	</ul>
<p>When the Seller fails to ship the Tickets or ships erroneous Tickets that the Buyer does not accept, and StubHub has to give a refund to the Buyer or replace the order with another Seller's tickets, the Seller will not receive the total amount of the sale, and must pay StubHub an economic penalty fee for failed order. </p>
<p>The penalty for failed order will be the result of the difference between the price at which the Tickets were sold and the price of the replacement Tickets, which will be from the same category or better. The minimum amount of the penalisation for Failed Order may be consulted at the following link: <u><a href="https://www.stubhub.com.au/information/penalties" target="_blank">Penalties</a></u>.</p>
<p>The Seller will be able to ask StubHub for the return of the Ticket that was mistakenly sent, only if the Buyer does not accept said Ticket. The amount due for the return of the Tickets to the Seller will be completely at the Sellers expense. Furthermore, in order to exercise the right to a refund, the Buyer must return the erroneous Tickets to StubHub. </p>

<h3>3.12. Delivery of Tickets by the Seller.</h3>
<p>The Seller is solely responsible for the pickup of packages for shipment of Tickets that they are offering. Taking into account that delivery processes may vary in accordance with the different delivery services available for use, it is the exclusive responsibility of the Seller to: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Make delivery arrangements within the term set for delivery of the event in question. </li>
		<li>When a shipping label must be printed, it is the sole responsibility of the Seller to print the label correctly. </li>
		<li>When shipping label is not required to be printed: Write correctly and legibly any address and contact information for the Sender and Receiver of the package. </li>
		<li>Place the correct tickets in accordance with the sale within the envelope for delivery. </li>
		<li>Correctly seal the envelope with the tickets so that it does not accidentally open during the process of delivery. </li>
		<li>When there is a shipping label: Ensure that the messenger correctly scans the label and therefore correctly registers the pick-up of the envelope. </li>
		<li>When there is no shipment label: Ensure that the messenger takes note of all information and numbers of the envelopes picked up correctly in the pick up note. </li>
		<li>Keep any pick up note or receipt of pickup issued by the messaging Service that has taken the envelope. </li>
	</ul>
<p>If there is a problem with delivery and the Seller has failed to keep any delivery receipts or the shipment label has been incorrectly scanned, StubHub will be unable to verify that the package has been picked up and therefore will hold the Seller responsible for the failed order and will apply to the Seller the penalty fees mentioned in the corresponding section about failed sales. </p>

<h3>3.13. Electronic Tickets. (e-Tickets)</h3>
<p>If the Seller fails upon sending or uploading the correct tickets as described in the Offer, StubHub will charge them with the corresponding penalties in accordance with the failed delivery. If the Seller uploads or sends by e-mail an invalid PDF file (or a file of another format) or creates their own file by scanning or photocopying paper tickets, this will cause the cancellation of the sale and the corresponding administrative fees will be charged to the Seller. </p>

<h3>3.14. Immediate delivery of the Tickets.</h3>
<p>Upon indicating in the Offer that the Tickets are of "immediate delivery", the Seller commits to send them in the 72 hours following the date of the sale. Past these 72 hours, StubHub may cancel the sale with no compensation to the Seller. If the sale is not cancelled, upon the discretion of StubHub, the Seller will be penalized for the delayed delivery of the tickets (the penalization is described in point 3.11.1 of this document). The decision to apply one penalty or another is exclusive to StubHub. Once the "immediate delivery" term is passed (72 hours after the sale), StubHub will decide whether the sale will be cancelled or maintained, applying the corresponding late delivery fee. </p>

<h3>3.15. Amount earned by the Seller in the Transaction.</h3>
<p>StubHub will credit the amount due from valid completed transactions by the Seller in the method selected at the moment of making the offer. The liquid amount that StubHub will credit the Seller will be that which was determined at the moment of making the Offer in accordance with section 3.7. </p>

<h3>3.16. Term and conditions of payment to Seller for the transaction.</h3>
<p>The sales for passed events are accounted for on the second and fourth working Monday of each month. The order of payment for these sales will be made two working days after said Monday. The period which it takes for one to receive their payment is dependent upon the chosen payment method.</p>
	
<h3>3.17. Closing a StubHub Account.</h3>
<p>StubHub reserves the right of admission and exclusion from the Website. Any Seller who is not compliant with the contents of the present Terms and Conditions may be excluded from the Website. The Seller has the obligation to complete all pending orders upon closing the account. StubHub reserves the right to cancel any sale of a Seller when the Sellers account is closed. Once the closing of the account is processed, StubHub will settle all payments due to the Seller, after subtracting the applicable penalty fees due. </p>

<h2>4. Ticket purchase.</h2>
<h3>4.1. Acceptance of an Offer.</h3>
<p>Any Buyer who is interested in acquiring any of the Tickets offered must expressly accept all Terms and Conditions. Acceptance of the terms of the Offer in question will imply acceptance of the price set by the Seller (the price will be determined solely by the Seller therefore there could be differences in the prices), the cost of the Services rendered by StubHub which will be calculated in accordance with section 3 and any transportation and delivery charges due. </p>

<h3>4.2. Allocation and confirmation of the purchase.</h3>
<p>Once the purchase has been made, StubHub will send a pending or confirmation e-mail, depending on the case, to the address facilitated by the Buyer, including the information of the transaction in question. This communication will serve as proof of the transaction between the Buyer and the Seller. Buyers, in the case that they are unable to attend the event, may use the Service once again to Offer the purchased Ticket acquired. </p>
<p>When the Seller fails to follow the Terms and Conditions, and where possible, StubHub will send the Buyer better tickets concluding the purchase in all effects. If the delivery of other tickets is not possible StubHub would proceed with refunding the Buyer through the same system used for payment of the purchase, the amounts previously charged for the Tickets. </p>

		<li>Shipment costs, if applicable, plus any taxes if applicable</li>
		<li>Service fee (point 3.4 of these Conditions).</li>
	</ul>
<p>The price of Offer set by the Seller is the one posted on the Website related to the event for which a Seller has made an Offer in accordance with these Terms and Conditions.  </p>
<p>Shipment costs are those costs generated by the delivery to the Buyer of the Tickets acquired through the Website in use of the delivery Services indicated.  </p>
<p>The Service fee is composed of the fees charged by StubHub for use of the Website by the Buyer that is determined according to the following paragraph. Including any taxes, if applicable.</p>

<h3>4.4. Service fee for the purchase of tickets.</h3>
<p>The purchase of Tickets incurs a cost for the Service in favour of StubHub for all transactions effectively completed through the Website. This fee of the Services rendered by StubHub will be determined in the following fashion: </p>
